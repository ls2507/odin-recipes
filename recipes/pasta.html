        <li>Gather the ingredients:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces (225 grams) of dried pasta (e.g., spaghetti, penne, fettuccine)</li>
            <li>Salt (for boiling water)</li>
            <li>Water (for boiling pasta)</li>
            <li>Sauce of your choice (e.g., marinara, Alfredo, pesto)</li>
            <li>Optional toppings or additions (e.g., cooked meat, vegetables, grated cheese, herbs)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Add the dried pasta to the boiling water and cook it according to the package instructions until it reaches the desired level of doneness (usually around 8-12 minutes). Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce of your choice. If using a store-bought sauce, heat it in a separate saucepan over medium heat. If making a homemade sauce, follow your preferred recipe.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, carefully drain it in a colander or use a pasta scoop to remove it from the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked pasta to a large serving bowl or individual plates.</li>
        <li>Pour the prepared sauce over the pasta and toss to coat the noodles evenly. Add any additional toppings or additions at this stage.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta hot and, if desired, garnish with grated cheese or fresh herbs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><h3>ENJOY!</h3></p>
