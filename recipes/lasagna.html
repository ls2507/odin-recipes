        <li>Gather the ingredients:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound (450 grams) ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces or 400 grams) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can (6 ounces or 170 grams) tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups (500 grams) ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups (200 grams) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (50 grams) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, chopped (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the noodles and set them aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Add some salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the chopped fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Add another layer of meat sauce, followed by another layer of noodles and ricotta cheese. Repeat the process until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese over the top of the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the lasagna is heated through.</li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><h3>Enjoy!</h3></p>
