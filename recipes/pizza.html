    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the warm water and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix with a spoon or your hands until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel. Allow it to rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) or the temperature recommended by your pizza stone or baking sheet instructions.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Transfer it to a floured surface and divide it into two equal portions if making two pizzas.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough into a round shape or your desired shape and thickness. If needed, use a rolling pin to help achieve an even thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a baking sheet or pizza stone. If using a baking sheet, you may want to sprinkle some cornmeal or flour on the sheet to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Add your desired pizza toppings, such as tomato sauce, shredded cheese, vegetables, meats, and herbs. Be creative with your choices!</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Slice it into pieces and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><h3>Enjoy your homemade pizza!</h3></p>
